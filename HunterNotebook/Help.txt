Welcome to the Hunter Notebook, a small c# powered notepad replacement that 
includes some bells and whistles. T.L.D.R  Look at the options and Toys section
for what exactle is something extra.

Command line Usage:

HunterNotebook.exe "file"
	this attempts to determine if the file is unicode or ansi via a built in Windows Routine and  and then loads it as a plain text file

HunterNotebook.exe -noconfig
	this turns off processing the logged in user's config (if any) 

HunterNotebook.exe -load {ANSI, RTF, UNICODE} "file"
	load the target with the specified format



A good portion of the config settings are store in a config file named HunterNotebook.xml in the user's logged in profile.
If you happen to be using the debug version stuff then a different Hunternotebookdebug.xml is used if it exists. Do note; however, that
the debug code is programmed to delete the debug config file by default. One may chose this by setting InternalConfig.DisableDebugConfigDelete to true
